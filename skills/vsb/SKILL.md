  Use the vsb CLI to generate AI media via Visual Sandbox — image, video,
  audio, 3D, vector. Trigger when the user mentions "vsb", "Visual Sandbox CLI",
  "generate an image/video/audio", "run a model", or asks to produce media via
  shell. Always pipe through --json when output will be parsed by an agent.

# vsb CLI

`vsb` is the Visual Sandbox command-line tool. Pretty output for humans, structured JSON for agents. Every successful run charges the configured account — costs are real.

For full reference (every command, every flag, every exit code), see
[references/full-reference.md](references/full-reference.md).

## Critical rules (read first)

1. **Always pass `--json` when an agent will read the output.** Pretty mode is human-only and is unstable across versions. (Output also auto-switches to JSON when stdout is piped — but be explicit.)
2. **Never invent slugs.** Use `vsb models "<query>" --json` to discover, then `vsb schema <category>/<slug> --json` to verify before `vsb run`.
3. **Slugs are `<category>/<name>`.** Examples: `image/nano-banana`, `video/veo-3.1`, `audio/elevenlabs-sound-fx`. Some names contain a slash (`vector/google/gemini-3.1-pro`) — keep them as one token.
4. **Inspect schema before running.** `vsb schema <slug> --json` shows exact field names, types, defaults, enums, and which are required.
5. **Local saves are opt-in — ask the user first, including where.** Never pass `--download` by default. Every run already lands on their canvas at `https://visualsandbox.com/sandbox/`, so a local copy is optional. Ask once per session ("Want these saved locally? Current folder or somewhere else?") and remember the answer — bare `--download` writes to the current working directory; pass a path (`--download ./renders/`) to save elsewhere. When they do want files, use `--download`, never `curl` — the CLI handles auth headers, redirects, and naming templates (`{request_id}`, `{index}`, `{ext}`).
   When the user did **not** opt into local saves, present the result as its share page, not a raw CDN URL: `https://visualsandbox.com/share/<job_id>/` (against local dev, same path on the dev host, e.g. `http://127.0.0.1:8000/share/<job_id>/`). The `job_id` from `vsb run`/`vsb status` *is* the generation uuid the share page expects. Raw `cdn.visualsandbox.com` URLs are for machine use only — chaining a result into the next run (`--image_urls`, `image_input`), never as the user-facing "here's your image" link.
6. **Image is sync, video and audio are async.** Image runs typically finish in ~5–10s — `vsb run image/...` blocks fine. Video/audio can take 30s–3min — use `--async`, then poll with `vsb status <job_id> --result --download <template>`. Never let a running job block the conversation — see [Background generations](#background-generations-keep-the-conversation-free).
7. **Estimate cost first.** `vsb pricing <category>/<slug> --json` returns `user_cost_estimate`. Show it to the user before running expensive video models.
8. **Auth.** Run `vsb setup` once — opens a browser to issue an API key, writes it to `~/.vsb/config.json`. Or set `VSB_API_KEY` in the env / `.env`. `vsb pricing` and most write endpoints require auth.
9. **Every `vsb run` auto-attaches to the user's live sandbox.** Each completed generation becomes a draggable node on `https://visualsandbox.com/sandbox/`. To opt out for a one-off script, pass `--no-sandbox`. To target a non-default sandbox, pass `--sandbox-uuid <uuid>`. Runs with `n>1` (currently `image/gpt-image-2`) drop **one node per output image**; each gets its own `output_index` (0..N-1) so every variant is reachable on the canvas.
10. **Selection-aware prompts.** When the user's request references "this", "him", "the image", "selected", "that one" — or anything that implies a subject already on screen — call `vsb sandbox selection --json` first. Returns the node(s) the user has selected on the canvas: prompt, model, output URL. Pass the `output_url` as the input image to the next `vsb run` (e.g. `--image_urls "[\"<url>\"]"` for nano-banana). If selection is empty, ask the user to click a node before continuing.
11. **Canvas survey vs drill-in.** Use `vsb sandbox nodes --json --limit N` for a slim overview of the whole canvas (~360 B/node — newest first, just uuid + slug + url + position). When you've picked a target, `vsb sandbox node <uuid> --json` returns full detail (prompt + all output URLs + media_asset). This two-step keeps context cheap even on a 20+ node sandbox.

## Background generations (keep the conversation free)

A running job must never hold the agent's turn hostage. Start it, note the id, keep working.

- Start long jobs (video, audio, batches) with `--async --json`, capture `job_id`, move on immediately.
- Don't call `vsb status --result` right after starting — it blocks until the job finishes. Check `.status` non-blocking instead: `vsb status <job_id> --json | jq -r '.status'`.
- Pending jobs carry `eta_seconds` (typical wall time for this model) and `elapsed_seconds` — sleep for roughly `eta_seconds - elapsed_seconds` before the next poll instead of a blind interval.
- If the agent harness supports background shells (e.g. Claude Code `run_in_background`), run the wait there — `vsb status <job_id> --result --json` in a background task notifies on completion while the conversation continues.
- Between other tasks (or when the user asks "is it done?"), sweep everything still running in one call: `vsb jobs --pending --json`. Works even when you never captured the ids (session restart, jobs started elsewhere).
- Only after `status == "completed"`, fetch the result: `vsb status <job_id> --result --json`. Add `--download "./out/{request_id}.{ext}"` only if the user asked for local copies (critical rule 5).
- When reporting a finished job, link its share page — `https://visualsandbox.com/share/<job_id>/` — and mention it's also on their canvas at `https://visualsandbox.com/sandbox/`. Don't paste raw CDN URLs (critical rule 5).
- Keep serving other `vsb` requests (images, schema lookups, more runs) while jobs cook — async jobs are independent; parallel is fine.

## Command index

| Command | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `vsb setup` | One-click onboarding — installs skills + browser auth, no prompts |
| `vsb models [query]` | Search the catalog (filter by `--category`, `--modality`, `--status`) |
| `vsb schema <slug>` | Inspect inputs/outputs (`--format compact|openapi`) |
| `vsb pricing <slug>` | Cost lookup (Bearer auth required) |
| `vsb run <slug> --<input> <value>` | Execute a model — sync by default, `--async` to queue |
| `vsb status <job_id>` | Poll a job (`--result`, `--cancel`, `--download [template]`) |
| `vsb jobs` | List recent jobs, newest first (`--pending`, `--status`, `--limit N`) — pending rows carry `eta_seconds` + `elapsed_seconds` |
| `vsb upload <path-or-url>` | Upload local file or remote URL to VS CDN |
| `vsb presets <list|get|run|create|delete>` | Manage saved model+inputs presets |
| `vsb sandbox selection` | Read what the user has selected on the canvas (prompt, model, image URL) |
| `vsb sandbox nodes` | List every node on the active sandbox (slim by default, `--full` for raw, `--limit N` to cap, `--kind generation\|upload` to filter) |
| `vsb sandbox node <uuid>` | Full detail for one node — prompt, all output URLs, media_asset, position |
| `vsb feedback "<msg>"` | Send feedback/bug report to the Visual Sandbox team (`--kind`, `--image`) |
| `vsb skills <list|install|update|remove>` | Manage agent skill packs in `.claude/skills/` |
| `vsb init` | One-shot install of the default skill bundle |
| `vsb update` | Update the CLI binary now (auto-update runs in the background by default) |

The CLI keeps itself and installed skills current automatically: minor/patch releases swap the binary in the background, and on startup installed skills are re-synced to match the running binary. No action needed — details and opt-outs in [full-reference.md](references/full-reference.md#vsb-update--auto-update).

## JobOut shape (what `run` and `status` return)

```json
{
  "job_id": "8f3...",
  "category": "image",
  "slug": "nano-banana",
  "status": "queued|in_progress|completed|failed|cancelled",
  "progress": null,
  "created_at": "2026-05-10T14:00:00Z",
  "completed_at": "2026-05-10T14:00:08Z",
  "eta_seconds": null,
  "elapsed_seconds": null,
  "share_url": "https://visualsandbox.com/share/8f3.../",
  "result": {
    "urls": ["https://cdn.visualsandbox.com/.../out.jpg"],
    "format": "jpg",
    "width": 1024,
    "height": 1024,
    "cost": 0.04875,
    "predict_time": 5.167
  },
  "error": null
}
```

On failure, `result` is `null` and `error` is `{code, message, retry_after, details}`. Status `"in_progress"` is the same as `"processing"` — both mean "still running."

While a job is pending, `eta_seconds` (how long this model typically takes, per-model server average) and `elapsed_seconds` (how long it's been running) are set — remaining ≈ `eta_seconds - elapsed_seconds`; pick your poll sleep from it instead of a blind interval. Both go `null` once terminal. `share_url` is the public result page — the user-facing link (critical rule 5).

## Quick patterns

### 1. Fast image (sync + download)

```bash
vsb run image/nano-banana \
  --prompt "a calico cat in a sunlit kitchen" \
  --aspect_ratio 16:9 \
  --download "./out/{request_id}.{ext}" \
  --json
```

`--download` in these patterns assumes the user said yes to local saves (critical rule 5) — drop it otherwise and hand back the share page (`https://visualsandbox.com/share/<job_id>/`); the result is on their canvas either way.

### 2. Discover when the user gives a fuzzy task

```bash
# "Make me a video of a tiger"
vsb models "video" --modality video --limit 5 --json | jq '.models[] | {slug, category, display_name}'
vsb schema video/veo-3.1 --json | jq '.inputs'
```

### 3. Async + poll (video / audio)

```bash
JOB=$(vsb run video/veo-3.1-fast --prompt "a tiger walking through tall grass" --async --json | jq -r '.job_id')

# Poll yourself, or just call status with --result --download which waits-by-fetching:
vsb status "$JOB" --json | jq '.status'
# When status == "completed":
vsb status "$JOB" --result --download "./out/{request_id}.{ext}" --json
```

### 4. Upload a local image, then edit it

```bash
URL=$(vsb upload ./photo.jpg --json | jq -r '.url')
vsb run image/nano-banana \
  --prompt "make the sky stormy" \
  --image_input "[\"$URL\"]" \
  --download "./out/" \
  --json
```

`image/nano-banana` takes a reference-image array (currently `image_input`). Pass it as a JSON literal — the CLI's `--key value` parser auto-coerces JSON. Other models name the field differently — never assume; the CLI rejects unknown flags with a "Did you mean…?" hint, but `vsb schema <slug>` is the fastest source of truth.

### 5. Cancel a runaway job

```bash
vsb status "$JOB" --cancel --json
```

### 6. Survey the canvas (when nothing's selected)

When the user references the canvas in general ("what's on my board", "redo the third one", "the kitchen photo from earlier") rather than a specific selection, list nodes first:

```bash
vsb sandbox nodes --json --limit 10
# → {"sandbox_uuid":"...","total":22,"nodes":[{"uuid":"...","slug":"image/gpt-image-2","output_index":1,"url":"...","pos":[-289,1937]}, ...]}
```

Slim shape is ~360 B/node so 20+ nodes still fit in a few KB. Pick a uuid by the slug or thumbnail URL, then drill in:

```bash
vsb sandbox node <uuid> --json
# → full prompt + all output_urls + media_asset
```

Use this pair before falling back to "ask the user to select a node". For n>1 runs, each output_index is a separate node — list them and pick.

### 7. Act on the user's canvas selection

When the user says "make him purple", "remove the background", "stylize this" — they're pointing at a node already on the canvas. Read the selection first, then chain it into the next run.

**Before writing the prompt, read the [`image-prompting`](../image-prompting/SKILL.md) skill.** Attaching a reference image is not enough — the prompt must say what to *keep* from the reference (subject identity) and what to *ignore* (watermarks, captions, text overlays, original background, original lighting). Without that, the model bleeds the reference's artifacts (corner watermarks, TikTok caption bars, the old scene's framing) into the new image.

```bash
SEL=$(vsb sandbox selection --json)
URL=$(echo "$SEL" | jq -r '.nodes[0].generation.output_urls[0] // .nodes[0].media_asset.url')
[ -z "$URL" ] && { echo "Select a node on the canvas first." >&2; exit 1; }

vsb run image/nano-banana \
  --prompt "Use the reference image as the IDENTITY source only. Keep the subject's face, hair, skin tone, body proportions. Ignore everything else — including watermarks, text overlays, captions, original background, original lighting, original framing.

Now: make the subject's sweater purple, same scene, same lighting. No logos, no captions, no watermarks." \
  --image_input "[\"$URL\"]" \
  --json
```

Pull the original prompt out of the selection (`.nodes[0].generation.prompt`) when you want to refine vs replace ("same scene, but at night") — but rewrite it into the keep/ignore + new-scene shape from [`image-prompting`](../image-prompting/SKILL.md), don't just copy it verbatim. The result lands back on the canvas next to the original.

**Fanning out N variations from one reference (character pack):** same pattern, looped or run in parallel. Use one keep/ignore preamble per scene, vary only the new-scene description. See `image-prompting` for the full template.

### 8. Recover the result URLs of a past job

If you forgot to capture the output URLs (or the JSON got truncated by a shell
pipe), refetch them by job id:

```bash
vsb status <job_id> --result --json | jq '.result.urls'
```

`--result` blocks if the job is still running; for an instant peek skip it and
inspect `.status` first.

## When something breaks — offer to send feedback

`vsb feedback` sends a message (and optional screenshot) straight to the Visual Sandbox team.

- On a persistent error, a broken model, or anything the user is unhappy with, offer: "Want me to report this to the developer?"
- Never send without asking first — feedback is tied to the user's account.
- On yes, write a short paragraph yourself — what was run, what was expected, what actually happened (exact error message, exit code, `job_id` if there is one) — show it to the user, then send:

```bash
vsb feedback "Ran image/nano-banana with image_input; expected an edited image, got exit 1 'ProviderError: upstream 500' after 3 retries. job_id 8f3..." --kind bug --json
```

- Not a bug: if the CLI refuses to run with an unsupported-version error (`error_type: "unsupported_version"` on stderr), run `vsb update --json` and retry the original command — don't report it.
- `--kind`: `bug` for errors, `comment` for suggestions/feature requests, `like` for praise (default: `comment`).
- `--image <path>` attaches a screenshot (png/jpg/gif/webp, max 8 MB).
- CLI version + platform are appended automatically — don't repeat them in the message.

## Exit codes (for shell scripting)

| Code | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| 0    | Success |
| 1    | Generic failure (job failed, server error) |
| 2    | Validation error (bad slug, missing required input, bad flag) |
| 3    | Auth error (no API key, expired, wrong scope) |
| 4    | Insufficient credits |
| 5    | Provider overloaded / rate-limited |
| 124  | Job cancelled |
| 130  | User interrupt (Ctrl-C) |

`vsb` always writes errors to stderr as JSON when `--json` is set, so a wrapping agent can read both stdout and stderr structured.

## Slug families to know (verify with `vsb models --json`)

- **Image** (sync, ~5–10s): `image/nano-banana`, `image/nano-banana-2`, `image/nano-banana-pro`, `image/gpt-image-2`
- **Image enhance**: `image-enhance/recraft-remove-background`, `image-enhance/upscale`
- **Video** (always async, 30s–3min): `video/seedance-2`, `video/seedance-2-fast`, `video/kling-v3-motion-control`, `video/veo-3.1`, `video/veo-3.1-fast`
- **Audio** (async, 5–30s): `audio/elevenlabs-sound-fx`
- **3D**: `3d/hunyuan-3d-3.1`
- **Vector**: `vector/google/gemini-3.1-pro` (slashed name), `vector/quiver-arrow-1.1`
- **Text**: `text/openrouter-chat`

For per-modality recipes, see the sibling skills: `image`, `video`, `audio`, `presets`.
